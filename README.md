## Introduction 

A simple calendar application for scheduling your work day. This application allows users to input tasks/events for each hour of the work day and saves them locally so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features 

• Current Date and Time: The scheduler displays the current date and time at the top of the page, so you always know the current time while planning your day.

• Hourly Task Input: You can input tasks or events for each hour of your work day. Simply click on the text area corresponding to the desired hour and type in your task or event.

• Local Storage: The scheduler utilizes the browser's local storage functionality to save your tasks or events locally. This means that even if you refresh the page or close the browser, your schedule will persist.

• Color-coded Time Blocks: The time blocks for each hour are color-coded based on the current time. Past hours are displayed in gray, the current hour is highlighted in red, and future hours are displayed in green. This visual distinction helps you quickly identify where you are in your work day.

• Responsive Design: The scheduler is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
